<h1>Homework 2: Make QEMU, boot xv6, understand page tables</h1> 

<h3>Question 1: What is on the stack?</h3>

The stack printout looks like that: 
<pre>
(gdb) x/24x $esp
0x7bcc:	0x00007db7	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bdc:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bec:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bfc:	0x00007c4d	0x8ec031fa	0x8ec08ed8	0xa864e4d0
0x7c0c:	0xb0fa7502	0xe464e6d1	0x7502a864	0xe6dfb0fa
0x7c1c:	0x16010f60	0x200f7c78	0xc88366c0	0xc0220f01
</pre>

<p>To approach this assignment you first look at  "Lecture 07 - System boot" to understand 
how xv6 starts, and when the first stack is created. Of course, you should also get an idea 
where are you know, i.e., where in the boot process you are when 0x0010000c is triggered. 

Ok, from Lecture 07 you know that the kernel starts by executing the code of the bootblock. 
Specifically the BIOS loads the first 512 bytes of disk into 0x7c00 and jumps there. This 
code is located in bootasm.S. As you go through the lecture you will see that the first stack 
is initialised with the following <tt>movl</tt> instruction right before calling the first C 
function bootmain:
<pre>
  movl    $start, %esp
  call    bootmain
</pre>

Since <tt>$start</tt> is linked to be 0x7c00, your stack is initialized to start at 0x7c00, and 
it will grow downwards. 

Now you want to understand what is going to happen with the stack as you invoke the <tt>bootmain</tt>
function. At this point you have to review how C functions interact with the stack. We convered this in 
" Lecture 05 - Calling conventions". xv6 conveniently provides the asm code for the bootmain function 
in <tt>bootblock.asm</tt>.

The <tt>call</tt> instruction saves the return address on the stack, so this is why 0x00007c4d (the 
adderss of the next instruction after <tt>call    bootmain</tt> is pushed on the stack (check <tt>bootblock.asm</tt>). 

Now you're inside <tt>bootmain</tt> and you can take a look at what it does to the stack. Bootmain() follows the 
calling conventions and pushes the frame pointer <tt>%ebp</tt> on the stack. 
<pre>
00007d2f <bootmain>:

void readseg(uchar*, uint, uint);

void
bootmain(void)
{
    7d2f:       55                      push   %ebp
    7d30:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
    7d32:       57                      push   %edi
    7d33:       56                      push   %esi
    7d34:       53                      push   %ebx
    7d35:       83 ec 1c                sub    $0x1c,%esp
</pre>
It happens to be zero. Then it saves three 
registers: %edi, %esi, and %ebx as callee is responsible for saving them (see Lecture 05 - Calling conventions). They 
are also zeros. Then <tt>bootmain</tt> allocates space for local variables (it has 5 4 byte pointers). Hence, it has to 
subtract 20 bytes from the %esp value. However, it subtracts 28 bytes: 
<pre>
sub    $0x1c,%esp
</pre>
Why? It's an optimization. The compiler allocates the space for both local variables and 
for the arguments to the <tt>readseg((uchar*)elf, 4096, 0)</tt> function call 
that <tt>bootmain</tt> is about to do:
<pre>
  // Read 1st page off disk
  readseg((uchar*)elf, 4096, 0);
    7d38:       c7 44 24 08 00 00 00    movl   $0x0,0x8(%esp)
    7d3f:       00 
    7d40:       c7 44 24 04 00 10 00    movl   $0x1000,0x4(%esp)
    7d47:       00 
    7d48:       c7 04 24 00 00 01 00    movl   $0x10000,(%esp)
    7d4f:       e8 93 ff ff ff          call   7ce7 <readseg>
</pre>
Here since the space on the stack is already allocated instead of using <tt>push</tt> operations the 
code just moves arguments into the proper stack locations. The <tt>0x4(%esp)</tt> means <tt>%esp + 4</tt>. 


After <tt>bootmain</tt> is done reading the kernel into memory, it jumps to the entry point of the ELF file that it read. 
The entry point is stored as a value inside the ELF header, <tt>bootmain</tt> reads it, assigns it to the 
function pointer variable <tt>entry</tt>, and calls it:
<pre>
9243 // Call the entry point from the ELF header.
9244 // Does not return!
9245 entry = (void(*)(void))(elfâˆ’>entry);
9246 entry();
9247 }
</pre>
This entry point is adderss <tt>0x0010000c</tt> on which you set the breakpoint. And hence the stack you see after the 
breakpoint is triggered is the stack right after this call invocation in <tt>bootmain</tt>. Of course, the <tt>call</tt> instruction
pushed the return address on the stack, which is 0x00007db7
<pre>
  // Call the entry point from the ELF header.
  // Does not return!
  entry = (void(*)(void))(elf->entry);
  entry();
    7db1:       ff 15 18 00 01 00       call   *0x10018
}
    7db7:       83 c4 1c                add    $0x1c,%esp
</pre>
And thus, you see it at the very top of your stack in the printout. 

The last part of the question is: what are those numbers starting at 0x7c00? E.g., 0x8ec031fa, 0x8ec08ed8, 0xa864e4d0, etc.? 
Remember, the BIOS loaded the kernel boot loader code at 0x7c00, and these values are exactly the very fisrt machine instructions 
that the bootloader started executing, e.g., 
<pre>
.code16                       # Assemble for 16-bit mode
.globl start
start:
  cli                         # BIOS enabled interrupts; disable
    7c00:       fa                      cli
  
  # Zero data segment registers DS, ES, and SS.
  xorw    %ax,%ax             # Set %ax to zero
    7c01:       31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax
  movw    %ax,%ds             # -> Data Segment
    7c03:       8e d8                   mov    %eax,%ds
  movw    %ax,%es             # -> Extra Segment
    7c05:       8e c0                   mov    %eax,%es
  movw    %ax,%ss             # -> Stack Segment
    7c07:       8e d0                   mov    %eax,%ss
</pre>
You see 0xfa is <tt>cli</tt>, 0x31c0 are <tt>xorw %ax,%ax</tt>, 0x8e is the beginning of <tt>movw    %ax,%ds</tt>. Of course they are printed 
in reverse order due to endianness, but if you print them out as bytes, e.g.:
<pre>
(gdb) x/96b $esp
0x7bcc:	0xb7	0x7d	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7bd4:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7bdc:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7be4:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7bec:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7bf4:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7bfc:	0x4d	0x7c	0x00	0x00	0xfa	0x31	0xc0	0x8e
0x7c04:	0xd8	0x8e	0xc0	0x8e	0xd0	0xe4	0x64	0xa8
0x7c0c:	0x02	0x75	0xfa	0xb0	0xd1	0xe6	0x64	0xe4
0x7c14:	0x64	0xa8	0x02	0x75	0xfa	0xb0	0xdf	0xe6
0x7c1c:	0x60	0x0f	0x01	0x16	0x78	0x7c	0x0f	0x20
0x7c24:	0xc0	0x66	0x83	0xc8	0x01	0x0f	0x22	0xc0
</pre>
you will see them in order. 

<h2>Exercise 2: Understanding page tables</h2>

<h3>Question 1: Explain how virtual to physical address translation works</h3>

This question asks you to illustrate organization of the x86, 4K, 32bit page
table through a simple example. Assume that the hardware translates the virtual
address '0x402003' into the physical address '0x1003'. The physical addresses
of the page table directory and the page table (Level 2) involved in the
translation of this virtual address are 0x2000 and 0x0. 

If you represent 0x402003 as 10:10:12 bits you will have the following
<pre>
1:2:3
</pre>

Hence, the page table directory, entry 1 has to point to the physical addres of the 
page table (level 2), or 0x0. Inside Level 2 page the translation picks entry number 2, and 
thus it has to point to 0x1000 --- the physical address of the page that backs up 
virtual address 0x402003. 0x3 is an offset inside that page. 

<h3>Question 2: Why two-level page tables?</h3>

<p>
You probably wandered why the hardware uses two-level page table organization versus a
simple array for translation of virtual addresses. After all, an array that
contains physical addresses for each virtual address is sufficient. A virtual
address can be an index into the array, and the translation can be done as
<tt>physical = page_table_array[virtual]</tt>. To understand the benefits of
two level page tables lets compare the size of two-level page tables versus
such an array. First, find the size of the two-level page table that is
required to translate 3 distinct pages of virtual memory (e.g., an address space 
of a simple process that consists of only 3 pages: a page for text/code, a page 
for data, and a page for stack). Compare the size
of the page table with the size of the array implementation described above
(assume that array entries are 4 bytes each, and are identical to page table
entries (PTEs) of the second level of traditional two-level page tables). How
does the size of the page table changes when you need to map the entire 4GB
virtual address space?
</p>
<p>
The problem with the array, that you can't really skip entries. Even if you're
translating only small subset of virtual addresses out of the entire 4GB
virtual address space, you still need the entire array. Hence, the minimal page
table is the size of the array. Since we need to map all 4GB, we need to have
1,000,000 entries in the array (or 1,048,576 if you want to be specific).
Hence, the size of the array is 4 bytes x 1,048,576 or 4MB).  While on modern
machines 4MB is nothing, 10 years ago, it was a significant fraction of
available physical memory. 
</p>
<p>
If you're using two-level page tables, to map 3 virual addresses you only need
2 or 4 4KB page tables. You always need 1 page for the page table directory
(level 1), and then depending on you virual addresess you might need 1, 2, or 3
pages for the level 2 pages. I.e., if addresses are consecutive, you will only
1 page for level 2, but if they are 4MB apart (remember each level 2 page maps
4MBs of address space, it has 1024 entries, each mapping 4K page) you will need
2 or 3. 
</p>
<p>
However, if you need to map the entrie 4MB space, you will need all the level 2
pages. And hence the size of your page table will be 4MB + 4K (one page for the
page table directory). And at this point array woule be a better choice, since
the lookup would be faster. 
</p>

<h2>Exercise 3: What is the state of page tables after xv6 is done initializing
the first 4K page table?</h2>

<h3>Question 2: What is the state of page tables after <tt>kvmalloc()</tt>
returns?</h3>

<pre>
1800 // There is one page table per process, plus one thatâ€™s used when
1801 // a CPU is not running any process (kpgdir). The kernel uses the
1802 // current processâ€™s page table during system calls and interrupts;
1803 // page protection bits prevent user code from using the kernelâ€™s
1804 // mappings.
1805 //
1806 // setupkvm() and exec() set up every page table like this:
1807 //
1808 // 0..KERNBASE: user memory (text+data+stack+heap), mapped to
1809 // phys memory allocated by the kernel
1810 // KERNBASE..KERNBASE+EXTMEM: mapped to 0..EXTMEM (for I/O space)
1811 // KERNBASE+EXTMEM..data: mapped to EXTMEM..V2P(data)
1812 // for the kernelâ€™s instructions and r/o data
1813 // data..KERNBASE+PHYSTOP: mapped to V2P(data)..PHYSTOP,
1814 // rw data + free physical memory
1815 // 0xfe000000..0: mapped direct (devices such as ioapic)
1816 //
1817 // The kernel allocates physical memory for its heap and for user memory
1818 // between V2P(end) and the end of physical memory (PHYSTOP)
1819 // (directly addressable from end..P2V(PHYSTOP)).
1820
1821 // This table defines the kernelâ€™s mappings, which are present in
1822 // every processâ€™s page table.
1823 static struct kmap {
1824 void *virt;
1825 uint phys_start;
1826 uint phys_end;
1827 int perm;
1828 } kmap[] = {
1829 { (void*)KERNBASE, 0, EXTMEM, PTE_W}, // I/O space
1830 { (void*)KERNLINK, V2P(KERNLINK), V2P(data), 0}, // kern text+rodata
1831 { (void*)data, V2P(data), PHYSTOP, PTE_W}, // kern data+memory
1832 { (void*)DEVSPACE, DEVSPACE, 0, PTE_W}, // more devices
1833 };
</pre>

<pre>
0202 #define EXTMEM 0x100000 
0207 #define KERNBASE 0x80000000
0208 #define KERNLINK (KERNBASE+EXTMEM) 
0203 #define PHYSTOP 0xE000000
0204 #define DEVSPACE 0xFE000000 
</pre>

In other words, <tt>kvmalloc</tt> that calls <tt>setupkvm()</tt> sets up the page tables 
to map four regions of virtual memory: 
<ol>

<li> Virtual memory from virtual address 2GB (0x80000000) to 2GB + 1MB is
mapped to physical addresses 0x0...1MB</li> 

<li> Virtual memory that contains kernel code and read only kernel data are
mapped from virtual addresses starting at 2GB + 1MB to the virtual address
specified in <tt>data</tt>is mapped to 1MB physical to (kernel.data - 2GB)</li> 

<li> Virtual memory that contains kernel read/write data and all virtual memory
above it until PHYSTOP, i.e., the memory that starts at 2GB + 1MB + kernel.data
and lasts until PHYSTOP is mapped to the physical address (kernel.data - 2GB)
and up until PHYSTOP.</li> 

<li>Virtual memory starting at DEVSPACE and till the end of the virtual address
space (0xffffffff or 0x0) is mapped one-to-one to physical addresses starting
from DEVSPACE till the end of physical address space</li>

</ol> </div>
