<h1>Homework 1: Simple UNIX programs</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with how to build simple Unix 
programs, create Makefiles, look at assembly code, and use the GDB debugger. The things
you learn will prepare you to handle a more complex environment of the xv6 kernel required 
for the future homework. You can do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API (Linux
Openlab machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and
even MacOS, etc.). <b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b> 
Submit your programs and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at
the bottom of this page). 

<h2>Part 1: Simple UNIX programs</h2> 

<p>Download the <a href="main.c">main.c</a>, and look it over. This is a
skeleton for a simple UNIX program.  

<p>To compile <tt>main.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  On
Openlab machines, you can compile the skeleton with the following command: 

<pre> $ gcc main.c </pre> 

This will produce an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run: <pre> $ ./a.out </pre> 

<p>Alternatively you can pass an additional option to gcc to give a more
meaningful name to the compiled binary, like <pre> $gcc main.c -o hello</pre>

<p>Here gcc will compile your program as <tt>hello</tt>.  

In the rest of this part of the assignment you will explore how to automate program 
development with Makefiles, learn how debug your code with GDB, and disassemble the 
program to verify your understanding of assembly language. 

<h2>Part 2: Simple Makefiles</h2>

This part of the homework is adapted from <a href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/">http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/</a>
It aims to introduce you to basics of Makefiles and the <tt>make</tt> tool that provides a way to compile complex software projects like 
xv6 and Linux kernel. 

<p>Every makefile is composed of <i>targets</i>, <i>dependencies</i>, and commands to resolve the target, for example:</p>

<pre><i>
target: dependencies
[tab] system command
</i></pre>

<p>The most simple Makefile will have a default goal <i>all</i> and the command required to satisfy this goal:</p>
<pre>all:
    gcc main.c  -o hello
</pre>

<p>Just to get familiar with Makefiles, lets create a file named Makefile and put the text above into it. Then you can run:</p>

<pre>make</pre>

Instead of running GCC manually, the Makefile lets you compile <tt>main.c</tt> into the <tt>hello</tt> program. 

<p>In our example the only target in the Makefile is <i>all</i>. This is the default target for make. The <i>make</i> utility will try to resolve this target if no other one is specified.<br />
We also see that there are no dependencies for target <i>all</i>, so <i>make</i> safely executes the system commands specified.</p>
<p>Finally, make compiles the program according to the command line we gave it.</p>

<h3>Using dependencies</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to use different targets. It makes the Makefile more modular and allows assembling a complex project from multiple pieces.<br />
Here is an example:</p>

<pre>all: hello

hello: main.o 
    gcc main.o -o hello

main.o: main.c
    gcc -c main.c

clean:
    rm *.o hello

</pre>
<p>Now we see that the target <i>all</i> has only one dependency (i.e., <tt>hello</tt>), but no system commands. In order for <i>make</i> to execute correctly, it has to meet all the dependencies of the called target.</p>

<p>Each of the dependencies are searched through all the targets available and executed if found.</p>

<p>In this example we see the target called <i>clean</i>. It is useful to have such target if you want to have a fast way to get rid of all the object files and executables.</p>

<pre>make clean</pre>

<h3>Using variables and comments</h3>

<p>You can also use variables when writing Makefiles. It comes in handy in situations where you want to change the compiler, or compiler options.</p>
<pre>
# This is how you write comments
# Use gcc as a compiler
CC=gcc
# CFLAGS will be the options we'll pass to the compiler
CFLAGS=-c -Wall

all: hello

hello: main.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.o -o hello

main.o: main.c
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) main.c

clean:
    rm *.o hello

</pre>

<p>Variables can be very useful. To use them, just assign a value to a variable before you start writing your targets. After that, you can just use them with the dereference operator $(VAR).</p>

<h2>If you want to know more...</h2>

<p>With this brief introduction to Makefiles, you can create some very sophisticated mechanisms for compiling your projects. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. More documentation is available here: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Make documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a more automated Makefile that you might use in one of your projects (not required for this homework). 

<pre>CC=gcc
# Compiler flags
CFLAGS=-c -Wall
# Linker flags
LDFLAGS=
# You can add multiple source files here separated with spaces
SOURCES=main.c

# Replace .c with .o creating a list of object files
OBJECTS=$(SOURCES:.c=.o)

# Name executable 
EXECUTABLE=hello

all: $(SOURCES) $(EXECUTABLE)
    
$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS) 
    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@

# Rule that tells make how to make an object file out of a .c file 
.c.o:
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@

clean:
    rm *.o $(EXECUTABLE)
</pre>

<h2>What to submit</h2> 

Three Makefiles you created to compile your hello example

<h2>Part 3: Debugging programs with GDB</h2>

On UNIX systems the main debugger is GDB (GNU debugger). To be able to comfortably debug your code compile it with the -g option which will instruct the compiler to generate debug symbols (variable names, source lines, etc.) for the program. For example, change your Makefile to have

<pre> 
CFLAGS=-c -Wall -g -m32
</pre>

This will compile your hello program with debugging symbols (<tt>-g</tt> flag), and as a 32bit x86 executable (<tt>-m32</tt> flag) . Then you can start you program under control of gdb

<pre>
gdb hello
</pre>

This starts gdb ready to execute your <tt>hello</tt> program. To get it running type the <tt>run</tt> command in the GDB command prompt (or <tt>r</tt> -- short for run):

<pre>
gdb\> run
</pre>

Now the program runs and finished printing "Hello world". 

<p>
GDB is a feature-rich debugger, and it will take you some time to learn all the features. Here is a couple of starting points:
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gilpin/tutorial/#3.4">GDB tutorial</a>, 
<a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/97au/help/gdb-intro.html">GDB intro</a> and <a href="https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">GDB Cheat Sheet</a>.

<p>
At a high level you need only two main things: 1) breakpoints and 2) ability to examine data. Breakpoints can be set with the "b" command inside gdb.

<h3>Breakpoints and single stepping</h3>

Just to make debugging a bit more realistic lets add another function to our simple program. 
Lets change it to compute a sum of numbers from 0 to n. You can do this by implementing the following function

<pre>
unsigned long sum(int n) {
    int i;
    unsigned long sum = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = sum + i;
    }

    return sum;
}
</pre>

and calling it from <pre>main()</pre>

<pre>
int main(void) {

    unsigned long s;

    s = sum(100);
    printf("Hello world, the sum:%ld\n", s);
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>
Running the programs on its own is not that useful. Lets try setting a breakpoint on the "main" function to examine what the program is actually doing. 
For that type <tt>break <function_name></tt> in the GDB command prompt or <tt>b</tt> and then run the program with <tt>r</tt>
 
<pre>
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x56b: file main.c, line 26.
(gdb) r
Starting program: ...  

Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:26
26          s = sum(100);
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
The debugger stopped at the beginning of the <tt>main</tt> function (line 26 of <tt>main.c</tt>. You can examine the source code of the program by typing <tt>list</tt> or <tt>l</tt>

<pre>
(gdb) list
21
22      int main(void) {
23
24          unsigned long s;
25
26          s = sum(100);
27          printf("Hello world, the sum:%ld\n", s);
28          return 0;
29      }
30
</pre>

<p> Now you can execute the program line by line by typing <tt>next</tt> (execute next line, or <tt>n</tt> for short), and <tt>step</tt> (<tt>s</tt>) to step into a function. 

Try stepping into the <tt>sum</tt> function by running <tt>step</tt>

<pre>
(gdb) s
sum (n=100) at main.c:13
13          unsigned long sum = 0;
</pre>

<p>Here I'm inside the <tt>sum</tt> function, where I type <tt>l</tt> to list the source code, and then type <tt>n</tt> to execute it line by line (I type <tt>n</tt> once, and then simply hit "Enter" asking GDB to execute the last command for me

<pre>
(gdb) l
8       #include <sys/stat.h>
9       #include <sys/wait.h>
10
11      unsigned long sum(int n) {
12          int i;
13          unsigned long sum = 0;
14
15          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
16              sum = sum + i;
17          }
(gdb) n
15          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
(gdb)
16              sum = sum + i;
(gdb)
15          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
(gdb)
16              sum = sum + i;
</pre>

<h3>TUI: Graphical User Interface</h3>

The second most useful feature is the TUI mode that turns GDB into a real modern debugger. Here is a couple of links to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10115540/gdb-split-view-with-code">TUI</a>.

<p>
You can switch into TUI by pressing Ctrl-X and then "1", or start gdb in TUI mode right away

<pre>
  gdb hello -tui
</pre>

Or by typing this in the gdb command prompt
<pre>
(gdb) tui enable
</pre>

<p>

Start the program from the begginging and single step it with <tt>n</tt> and <tt>s</tt>. The source code of the program will be scrolling in the TUI window in the top part of the screen. 


<h3>Examining data</h3>
 
<p>
You can print values of variables with "print", e.g., print the values of <tt>i</tt> and <tt>sum</tt>

<pre>
  gdb\> p i
  gdb\> p sum
</pre>


<h3>Conditional breakpoints</h3>

While debugging programs it's often useful to see what the program is doing right before it crashes. One way to do this is to step through, one at a time, every statement of the program until we get to the point of execution where we want to see what is happening. This works, but sometimes you may want to just run to a particular section of code and stop execution at that point so you can examine data at that location.

<p>GDB allows you to set conditional breakpoints. For example, lets break inside the loop of the <tt>sum</tt> function when the index <tt>i</tt> is equal to 50. I first list the source code to get the exact source lines and then set a brakpoint inside the <tt>main.c</tt> file at line 16 with <tt>break main.c:16</tt>

<pre>
(gdb) l
11      unsigned long sum(int n) {
12          int i;
13          unsigned long sum = 0; 
14
15          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
16              sum = sum + i; 
17          }
18
19          return sum; 
20      }
(gdb) break main.c:16
Breakpoint 2 at 0x56555543: file main.c, line 16.
</pre>

This breakpoint will trigger for every iteration of the loop. So if we want it to fire only when <tt>i</tt> is 50 we add the following condition. I use <tt>2</tt> as this is the number of the breakpoint that I set at line 16. 

<pre>
(gdb) condition 2 i==50
</pre>

<p>I now continue execution of the program with the <tt>continue</tt> or <tt>c</tt> command. 

<pre>
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, sum (n=100) at main.c:16
16              sum = sum + i; 
</pre>

<p>
When the breakpoint is hit I check that the value of i is really 50
<pre>
(gdb) p i
$1 = 50
(gdb) 
</pre>

<h3>What to submit</h3>

The Makefile and the updated main.c program. 

<h2>Part 3: Exploring assembly code</h2>

In this part of the homework you will explore assembly code of the <tt>sum</tt> function. 

<p>Re-start GDB and set the breakpoint on the <tt>sum</tt> function

<pre>
(gdb) b sum
Breakpoint 1 at 0x533: file main.c, line 13.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/aburtsev/doc/OS_Stuff/Flux/git/personal/classes/os-class/cs143a/hw/hello 

Breakpoint 1, sum (n=100) at main.c:13
13          unsigned long sum = 0; 
</pre>

GDB can disassemble the code of the program with the <tt>disassemble</tt> (or <tt>disas</tt>) command
<pre>
(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function sum:
   0x5655552d <+0>:     push   %ebp
   0x5655552e <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp

   0x56555543 <+22>:    mov    -0x8(%ebp),%eax
   0x56555546 <+25>:    add    %eax,-0x4(%ebp)
   0x56555549 <+28>:    addl   $0x1,-0x8(%ebp)
   0x5655554d <+32>:    mov    -0x8(%ebp),%eax
   0x56555550 <+35>:    cmp    0x8(%ebp),%eax
   0x56555553 <+38>:    jl     0x56555543 <sum+22>
   0x56555555 <+40>:    mov    -0x4(%ebp),%eax

   0x56555559 <+44>:    ret    
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the default syntax for the disassembly is AT&T. So the first thing you do is switch to Intel syntax we were using in class. 
Invoke the <tt>set disassembly-flavor intel</tt> command and disassembly the function again

<pre>
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function sum:

   0x56555559 <+44>:    ret    
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) 
</pre>

<b>Your assignment is</b> to explain every line of the assembly dump and submit it as a text file. 

Note, while you can understand what the assembly code is doing, you can also use GDB to step through the assembly code of the program. 
You can simply type

<pre>
(gdb) layout asm
</pre>

to switch TUI to the assmebly mode. Then you can use two new GDB commands: <tt>nexti</tt> (<tt>ni</tt>) and <tt>stepi</tt> (<tt>si</tt>) for stepping 
through the assembly instructions (<i>i</i> stands for "instruction", e.g., next instruction and step instrucion). 

<pre>
(gdb) si
</pre>

<p>You can do the split layout to show both assembly and the C source code windows at the same time. 

<pre>
(gdb) layout split
</pre>


You can also show the registers on the screen (don't forget the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/TUI-Commands.html">list of TUI commands</a> --- they can be very handy). 

<pre>
(gdb) layout regs
</pre>

<h3>What to submit</h3>

A text file that explains every line of the assembly dump.  

<h2>Part 4: Exploring calling conventions</h2>

In this final part of the homework you will explore the calling conventions for passing the arguments on the stack. 

<p>Re-start GDB and set the breakpoint on the <tt>sum</tt> function, and run the program. 

<pre>

</pre>

<p><b>Explain every value from the dump above</b>, i.e., which one is a local 
variable inside <tt>sum</tt>, which is the frame pointer, what are the arguments to <tt>sum</tt> and 
so on. The more values you can exaplain the better. 

<p><b>Hints:</b> start from <tt>main</tt>, i.e., set a breakpoint on <tt>main</tt> and see how the values 
on the stack are changing, step through <tt>main</tt> and see what gets pushed on the stack. 

<p><b>Note:</b> GCC generates the code that keeps the stack aligned at 16 bytes, hence instead of allocating 4 bytes 
for the local variable in <tt>sum</tt> it allocates 16. 

<h3>What to submit</h3>

Submit a text file explaining every value on the stack.
