<h1>Homework 2: Make QEMU, boot xv6, understand page tables</h1> 

<p>To start working on this homework follow the xv6 <a href="xv6-setup.html">setup instructions</a>. After you're done with them, you'll be ready to start working on the assignment. 

<p><p> <h2>Exercise 1: Finding and breaking at an address</h2>

Find the address of <code>_start</code>, the entry point of the kernel:
<pre>
vagrant@odin$ nm kernel | grep _start
8010b50c D _binary_entryother_start
8010b4e0 D _binary_initcode_start
0010000c T _start
vagrant@odin$
</pre>
In this case, the address is <code>0010000c</code>.

<p>
Run the kernel inside QEMU GDB, setting a breakpoint
at <code>_start</code> (i.e., the address
you just found).
</p>

<pre>
vagrant@odin$ make qemu-nox-gdb
...
</pre>

Now open another terminal (<b>you do that on your openlab host machine, i.e., odin or tristram, whichever you're using</b>). Change to the folder 
where Vagrant is configured, and connect to the same Vagrant VM, i.e.: 
<pre>
odin$ cd ~/ics143a/xv6-vagrant-master/
odin$ vagrant ssh
</pre> 

In this new terminal (<b>but now inside your vagrant VM</b>) change to the folder where you've built xv6, and start GDB: 
<pre>
vagrant@odin$ cd /vagrant/ics143a/xv6-public
vagrant@odin$ gdb

+ target remote localhost:26000
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0]    0xffff0:	ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
+ symbol-file kernel
</pre>
Set a breakpoint at the address of <tt>_start</tt>, e.g.
<pre>
(gdb) br * 0x0010000c
Breakpoint 1 at 0x10000c
(gdb) c
Continuing.
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
=> 0x10000c:	mov    %cr4,%eax

Breakpoint 1, 0x0010000c in ?? ()
(gdb)
</pre>

The details of what you see are likely to differ from the above output.

<h3>Question 1: What is on the stack?</h3>

Look at the registers and the stack contents:

<pre>
(gdb) info reg
...
(gdb) x/24x $esp
...
(gdb)
</pre>

<p>Write a short (3-5 word) comment next to each <b>zero and non-zero</b> value on the stack
explaining what is.  Which part of the stack printout is actually the stack?
(Hint: not all of it.)

<p>You might find it convenient to consult the files bootasm.S, bootmain.c, and
bootblock.asm (which contains the output of the compiler/assembler).  The <a
href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/reference.html">reference page</a>
has pointers to x86 assembly documentation, if you are wondering about the
semantics of a particular instruction.  Here are some questions to help you
along:

<ul>

<li>Start by setting a break-point at 0x7c00, the start of the boot
  block (bootasm.S). Single step
  through the instructions (type si to the gdb prompt). Where in bootasm.S is
  the stack pointer initialized?

<li>Single step through the call to <tt>bootmain</tt>; what is on the stack now?

<li>What do the first <it>assembly</it> instructions of bootmain do to the
stack? Look for bootmain in bootblock.asm.

<li>Look in bootmain in bootblock.asm for the call that changes <tt>eip</tt> to
  </tt>0x10000c</tt>.  What does that call do to the stack?
  
</ul>

<h3>Tip</h3>
 
Since we're running QEMU in headless mode (`make clean qemu-nox`) you don't
have a GUI window to close whenever you want. There are two ways to exit QEMU. 

<ol>

<li>First, you can exit the xv6 QEMU session by killing the QEMU process from another terminal. 
A useful shortcut is to define an `alias` in your local machine as follows:

<pre>
alias kill-qemu='vagrant ssh -c "killall qemu-system-i386"'
</pre>

Add this to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file to make it persistant
This will send the `killall qemu-system-i386` command over ssh to your vagrant machine.
Notice this command will only work if you're running it from somewhere in the directory path of the Vagrantfile running this machine
</li>

<li>
Alternatively you can send a <b>Ctrl-a x</b> command to the QEMU emulator forcing it to exit 
(here is a <a href="http://wiki.qemu-project.org/download/qemu-doc.html#mux_005fkeys">list of QEMU
shortcuts and commands</a>). 
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise 2: Understanding page tables</h2>

<h3>Question 1: Explain how virtual to physical address translation works</h3>

This question asks you to illustrate organization of the x86, 4K, 32bit page
table through a simple example. Assume that the hardware translates the virtual
address '0xc02005' into the physical address '0x4005'. The physical addresses
of the page table directory and the page table (Level 2) involved in the
translation of this virtual address are respectively 0x1000 and 0x0. Draw a diagram (hand
drawn figures are sufficient, but need to be clear) representing the state of
the page table in physical memory and the process of translation (similar to
Figure 2-1 in the xv6 book but using concrete physical and virtual addresses
and page table entries). Provide a short explanation.  Use Chapter 2 of the <a
href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf">xv6 book</a> to
review how page tables work. 

<!--

<h3>Question 2: Why two-level page tables?</h3>

You probably wandered why the hardware uses two-level page table organization versus a
simple array for translation of virtual addresses. After all, an array that
contains physical addresses for each virtual address is sufficient. A virtual
address can be an index into the array, and the translation can be done as
<tt>physical = page_table_array[virtual]</tt>. To understand the benefits of
two level page tables lets compare the size of two-level page tables versus
such an array. First, find the size of the two-level page table that is
required to translate 3 distinct pages of virtual memory (e.g., an address space 
of a simple process that consists of only 3 pages: a page for text/code, a page 
for data, and a page for stack). Compare the size
of the page table with the size of the array implementation described above
(assume that array entries are 4 bytes each, and are identical to page table
entries (PTEs) of the second level of traditional two-level page tables). How
does the size of the page table changes when you need to map the entire 4GB
virtual address space? 

<h2>Exercise 3: What is the state of page tables after xv6 is done initializing
the first 4K page table?</h2>

During boot, xv6 calls the <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> function to set up the kernel
page table (<tt>kvmalloc()</tt> is called from <tt>main()</tt> (lines
1316-1340)).  What is the state of this first 4K page table after
<tt>kvmalloc()</tt> returns, and what are the details of page table
initialization? 

To understand the state of the page table, we first take a look at the
implementation of the <tt>kvmalloc</tt> function and then inspect the actual
page tables with the QEMU monitor. 

<h3>Question 1: Explain implementation of <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> and related functions</h3>

Use <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/xv6-rev9.pdf">xv6 source
code</a> to understand and explain implementation of the following functions:
<tt>setupkvm()</tt>, <tt> walkpgdir()</tt>, <tt>mappages()</tt>, and their role
in the implementation of <tt>kvmalloc()</tt>. Use line numbers from the source
printout to refer to specific places of code. Provide a reasonably detailed
description for individual lines of code to demonstrate your understanding of
the code. 

<h3>Question 2: What is the state of page tables after <tt>kvmalloc()</tt>
returns?</h3>

Based on your analysis of the source code, and based on the inspection of the
page tables with the QEMU monitor, explain the state of the page tables after
<tt>kvmalloc()</tt> is done. Draw a figure of a page table, and briefly explain
each page table entry. 

<p>To aid your analysis, inspect the actual page table with QEMU. QEMU includes
a built-in monitor that can inspect and modify the machine state in useful
ways.  To enter the monitor, press <b>Ctrl-a c</b> in the terminal running
QEMU.  Press <b>Ctrl-a c</b> again to switch back to the serial console.</p>

To inspect the page table, run xv6 to the point after it is done with
<tt>kvmalloc()</tt>.  Similar to Exercise 1, open two terminal windows. In one
window start xv6 under control of the GDB debugger

<pre>
vagrant@odin$make qemu-nox-gdb
</pre>

In another window start GDB
<pre>
vagrant@odin$ cd /vagrant/ics143a/xv6-public
vagrant@odin$ gdb 
</pre>

In the GDB window set breakpoint on <tt>main</tt> function, run continue (c), and run (n) executing functions inside <tt>main</tt> until you exit <tt>kvmalloc()</tt> (use "n" three times):
<pre>
(gdb) b main
(gdb) c
Continuing.
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
=> 0x80102eb0 <main>:	push   %ebp

Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:19
19	{
(gdb) n
=> 0x80102eba <main+10>:	movl   $0x80400000,0x4(%esp)
20	  kinit1(end, P2V(4*1024*1024)); // phys page allocator
(gdb) n
=> 0x80102ece <main+30>:	call   0x80106790 <kvmalloc>
21	  kvmalloc();      // kernel page table
(gdb) n
=> 0x80102ed3 <main+35>:	call   0x80103070 <mpinit>
22	  mpinit();        // detect other processors
</pre>

<p>At this point switch back to the terminal running the QEMU monitor and type
<tt>info pg</tt> to display the state of the active page table. You will see
page directory entries and page table entries along with the permissions for
each separately.  Repeated PTE's and entire page tables are folded up into a
single line.  For example,

  <pre>VPN range     Entry         Flags        Physical page
[00000-003ff]  PDE[000]     -------UWP
  [00200-00233]  PTE[200-233] -------U-P 00380 0037e 0037d 0037c 0037b 0037a ..
[00800-00bff]  PDE[002]     ----A--UWP
  [00800-00801]  PTE[000-001] ----A--U-P 0034b 00349
  [00802-00802]  PTE[002]     -------U-P 00348
</pre>

  This shows two page directory entries, spanning virtual addresses
  0x00000000 to 0x003fffff and 0x00800000 to 0x00bfffff, respectively.
  Both PDE's are present, writable, and user and the second PDE is also
  accessed.  The second of these page tables maps three pages, spanning
  virtual addresses 0x00800000 through 0x00802fff, of which the first
  two are present, user, and accessed and the third is only present and
  user.  The first of these PTE's maps physical page 0x34b.
