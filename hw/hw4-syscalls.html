<h1>HW4: xv6 system calls</h1>

<p>In this homework you will modify xv6 to add a system call.  You can use the
same setup as for the <a href="hw2-boot-xv6.html">HW2: Xv6 boot</a>, and <a
href="hw3-hello.html">HW3: Xv6 hello world</a>.

<h2>Part One: dump() system call</h2>

<p> Your first task is to add a new system call to xv6. The main point of the
exercise is for you to see some of the different pieces of the system call
machinery.

<p> Your new system call will dump memory of a current process on the console

Specifically, your new system call will have the following interface: 

<pre> int dump(void *addr, void *buffer, int size); </pre> 


Where addr is the address inside the process memory from where the memory is
dumped, buffer is the user allocated buffer where content of the user memory is
saved, and size is the size of the memory region to dump. 

<p> You will have to dump the entire memory of the process on the console,
i.e., starting from address 0 to proc->sz. You can find proc->sz by invoking
the sbrk() system call and passing 0 as an argument. You will of course have to
loop through the entire memory and dump it on the console in a format similar
to how we dumped the stack in HW2. E.g., like this: 

<pre>
0x7bcc:	0x00007db7	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bdc:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bec:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
0x7bfc:	0x00007c4d	0x8ec031fa	0x8ec08ed8	0xa864e4d0
0x7c0c:	0xb0fa7502	0xe464e6d1	0x7502a864	0xe6dfb0fa
0x7c1c:	0x16010f60	0x200f7c78	0xc88366c0	0xc0220f01
</pre>




You should create a user-level program <tt>dump</tt> that calls your new system
call; here's an example template for <tt>dump.c</tt>:

<pre>
#include "types.h"
#include "stat.h"
#include "user.h"
#include "syscall.h"


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  // Dump memory here

  exit();
}
</pre>

<p>
In order to make your new <tt>dump</tt> program available to run from
the xv6 shell, add <tt>_dump</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> definition
in <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>Your strategy for making the <tt>dump</tt> system call should be to clone all of the
pieces of code that are specific to some existing system call, for example the
"uptime" system call. You should grep for uptime in all the source files, using
<tt>grep -n uptime *.[chS]</tt>.

<p> When you're done, typing <tt>dump</tt> to the xv6 shell prompt should print
entire memory of the process on the console. 

<!--<p> Don't forget that there is a guard page in between text and stack pages
of the user memory. If you try to dump the guard page  entire memory of the
process on the console. -->

<h2>Extra credit (5%): annotate text, guard, stack, and heap</h2>

<p> Change your <tt>dump.c</tt> program to annotate which memory is which,
i.e., text, guard, stack, and heap. You should be clever about detecting the section boundaries, i.e., look at the value of the stack pointer, rounding it to the page boundary, making a conclusion that above this page is heap, below is the guard page, etc. 

<h2>Extra credit (15%): implement ps, dump memory of a process with specific
process id</h2>

Implement the <tt>ps</tt> tool that lists all processes running on the system.
For that you should implement yet another system call that returns information
for a process. 

<p> The new system call will get information about the processes running in the
system and return it to the user program. Specifically, your new system call
will have the following interface: 


<pre> int getprocinfo(int pid, struct uproc *up); </pre> 

Where pid is the process id of the target process, and <tt>struct uproc</tt> is
a structure that describes the process, i.e., contains the following
information about the process: process name, process id, parent process id,
size of process memory, process state, whether process is waiting on a channel,
and whether it's been killed. 

<p>
You will have to define the <tt>struct uproc</tt> and implement the ps utility
by querying the system about all processes in the system.  
You should create a user-level program that calls your new date system
call; here's some source you should put in <tt>ps.c</tt>:

<p> When you're done, typing <tt>ps</tt> to an xv6 shell prompt should print
all processes running in the system and information about them. 

<p>Finally, change the <tt>dump</tt> system call to take the process id as an
argument. Now you can use <tt>ps</tt> to enumerate all processes in the system,
and then dump memory for one of them. Your new <tt>dump</tt> tool
(<tt>dump.c</tt>) should also accept a command line parameter, a process id
which memory is dumped. E.g., typing <tt>dump 2</tt> on the shell command
prompt should dump the memory of the process with id 2. 

<div class="question"> <p><b>Submit</b> <p>Submit your answers on Canvas <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/6422">HW4 Memory Dump</a> 
as a compressed tar file of your xv6
source tree (after running make clean). You can use
the following command to create a compressed tar file
<pre>
vagrant@odin$ cd /vagrant/ics143a
vagrant@odin$ make clean
vagrant@odin$ tar -czvf hw4.tgz xv6-public
</pre>
