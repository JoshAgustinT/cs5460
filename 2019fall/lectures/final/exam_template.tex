\question Pipes

Xv6 shell implements a pipe command (e.g., \texttt{ls | wc}) with the following code: 

\begin{verbatim}
8650   case PIPE:
8651     pcmd = (struct pipecmd*)cmd;
8652     if(pipe(p) < 0)
8653       panic("pipe");
         // Point A
8654     if(fork1() == 0){
8655       close(1);
8656       dup(p[1]);
8657       close(p[0]);
8658       close(p[1]);
           // point B
8659       runcmd(pcmd−>left);
8660     }
8661     if(fork1() == 0){
8662       close(0);
8663       dup(p[0]);
8664       close(p[0]);
8665       close(p[1]);
8666       runcmd(pcmd−>right);
8667     }
8668     close(p[0]);
8669     close(p[1]);
         // point C
8670     wait();
8671     wait();
8672     break
\end{verbatim}

Draw the connections between file descriptors, I/O devices and pipes at points
A, B above.  Connections can be depicted with lines with arrows. The error is
aligned with the direction of data flow, i.e., if the file is written the error
points at the file object.

\question Processes and system calls

\begin{parts}

\part[5] What is the first system call executed by xv6? Explain your answer. 


\if\answers1

exec(). It's executed by the first process that uses a simple assembly sequence to simply 
invoke exec() with the arguments needed to reload its address space with the ``init'' process.

\question Interrupts and context switch

\begin{parts} 

\part[5] When a user-program (a program that executes at current privilege
level 3) is preempted with an interrupt five registers are saved by the
hardware: ESP, SS, EFLAGS, CS, EIP. Why these five registers have to be saved,
but others, e.g., EAX, ECX, etc., don't? 


\if\answers1 

These five change right away, e.g., SS and ESP is changed to point to the kernel stack, EIP is 
changed to point to the interrupt handler entry, CS is changed to CS with privilege level 0, EFLAGS might 
be changed too since some interrupt handlers are configured to disable subsequent interrupts, etc. 

\fi

\vfill 


\part[5] During the context switch the code of the \texttt{swtch()} function
visibly does not save the EIP register. How is it saved and restored then
during the context switch?  

\if\answers1 

The EIP is pushed on the stack when swtch() is called. Since it's pushed on the stack it's 
accessible as part of the \texttt{struct context} data structure, and it will be restored 
into the EIP hardware register when \texttt{swtch()} executes the \texttt{ret} instruction. 

\fi

\vfill 

\newpage

\part[5] The \texttt{fork()} system call returns ``0'' inside the child
process. This return value is passed to the child process from inside the
\texttt{fork()} system call with the following line: 

\begin{verbatim} 
np->tf->eax = 0 
\end{verbatim}

Explain how does this work, i.e., how the ``0'' value ends up being 
returned by the fork() inside the user process. 

\if\answers1
For every process, the \texttt{struct trapframe} pointer \texttt{tf} points inside the kernel stack 
of that process.  \texttt{struct trapframe} is defined in such a way that its fields 
match the order in which hardware and low-level code of xv6 (i.e., \texttt{vectorXX}, \texttt{alltraps} push 
and restore values of the hardware registers used by the user process. When the new process is created 
with \texttt{fork()} the kernel creates the trapframe data structure to make sure it is possible to exit 
into that process when it is picked by the scheduler. Hence, \texttt{np->tf->eax} points 
to the exact location of 4 bytes that will be restored into the EAX register on the return path into the user-process when 
the kernel schedules and context switches into it. Since \texttt{fork()} puts ``0'' into the eax field of the 
trapframe data structure they will be restored from the kernel stack into the EAX register. It also happens that x86 32bit 
calling convention used by GCC compiler defines that EAX register contains the value returned from the function. This is how 
``0'' becomes the return value of the fork system call.

\part[5] What does the stack look inside the \texttt{bar()} function. Draw a diagram, provide a short description for every value on the stack. 

\begin{verbatim}
int bar(int a, void *buffer, int size) {


};

% Basic question
\addpoints \question File system


Xv6 lays out the file system on disk as follows:

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figs/fs}
  \label{fig:ramengine-decomposed-app}

\end{figure}

Block 1 contains the super block. Blocks 2 through 31 contain the log header
and the log. Blocks 32 through 57 contain inodes. Block 58 contains the bitmap
of free blocks. Blocks 59 through the end of the disk contain data blocks. 

 
\begin{parts} 

\part[5] Every file system transaction that changes the file system write one 
disk block twice. What is this block (what's its block number) and why is it 
written twice? 


\if\answers1 

Block 2 is written twice as it contains the log header. First it is written to commit 
the log and then it is written to mark the log as clear (after transactions are installed) 

\fi

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Synchronization

\begin{parts}

\part[5] Sleep  has  to  check \texttt{lk != \&ptable.lock} to  avoid a deadlock.  Suppose the
special  case when the following lines 

\begin{verbatim}
if(lk != &ptable.lock) { 
  acquire(&ptable.lock);
  release(lk);
}
\end{verbatim}

are replaced with

\begin{verbatim}
release(lk);
acquire(&ptable.lock);
\end{verbatim}

Doing this would break sleep. How?

\if\answers1 

It is critical to hold the ptable.lock before releasing the lk lock that is passed as an argument into \texttt{sleep()}. This is essential 
to avoid the lost wakeup problem --- \texttt{wakeup()} always acquires the ptable.lock before waking up the waiting processes. If the special 
case code is removed sooner or later the race will occur when the process that is going to sleep will reach the line that releases the lock, at this 
point it will be preempted by the process that is going to issue the wakeup() call, but since both the \texttt{lk} and the \texttt{ptable.lock} 
are released it will issue a wakup() call that will be lost by the preempted process that will continue with the sleep when it takes its turn to run. 

\fi


\vfill

\part[5] Now Alice decides to put the following code instead of the original \texttt{xchg()} loop in the \texttt{acquire()} function 

\begin{verbatim}
for(;;) {
  if(!lk->locked)
  {
    lk->locked = 1;
    break;
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

She boots xv6 on a multi-processor machine, explain what happens?

\if\answers1 

Now the two lines (and several assembly instructions that are involved in implementing those lines): the one line 
that checks the \texttt{locked} filed and the line that sets it are not atomic. Sooner or later it will result in a race when 
two processes will try to acquire the same lock on two different CPUs.
