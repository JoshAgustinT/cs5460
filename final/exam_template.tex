% Basic question
\addpoints
\question File system


Xv6 lays out the file system on disk as follows:

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figs/fs}
  \label{fig:ramengine-decomposed-app}

\end{figure}

Block 1 contains the super block. Blocks 2 through 31 contain the log header
and the log. Blocks 32 through 57 contain inodes. Block 58 contains the bitmap
of free blocks. Blocks 59 through the end of the disk contain data blocks.

Ben modifies the function bwrite in bio.c to print the block number of each
block written.

Ben boots xv6 with a fresh fs.img and types in the
command ln cat cat2. This command creates a symbolic link cat2 to file cat.
This command produces the following trace:

\begin{verbatim} 
$ ln cat cat2
write 3
write 4
write 2
write 32
write 59
write 2
$
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts} 

\part[5] Why is block 2 written twice? 

\vfill

\part[5] Briefly explain what block 32 contains in the above trace. Why is it written?

\vfill

\newpage

\part[5] What does block 3 contain? 


\vfill 


\part[5] If writes to 32 and 59 are reordered like below, will it violate correctness of the file system, explain why? 

\begin{verbatim}
$ ln cat cat2
write 3
write 4
write 2
write 59
write 32
write 2
$
\end{verbatim}

\question Memory management. 

\begin{parts}
\part[5] Explain organization of the xv6 memory allocator. 

\vfill

    
\part[5] Why do you think xv6 does not have buddy or slab allocators? Under 
what conditions you would have to add these allocators to the xv6 kernel? 


\vfill


\end{parts}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Synchronization

\begin{parts}

\part[10] The code below is the xv6's sleep() function. Remember the whole idea
of passing a lock inside sleep() is to make sure it is released before the
process goes to sleep (otherwise it will never be woken up). However, it looks
like that if the lock passed inside sleep is ptable.lock (i.e., lk ==
\&ptable.lock) the lock remains acquired and is never released. But xv6 does
call sleep with ptable.lock as an argument and it works, can you explain why? 

\begin{verbatim}
2806 // Atomically release lock and sleep on chan.
2807 // Reacquires lock when awakened.
2808 void
2809 sleep(void *chan, struct spinlock *lk)
2810 {
2811   if(proc == 0)
2812     panic("sleep");
2813
2814   if(lk == 0)
2815     panic("sleep without lk");
2816
2817   // Must acquire ptable.lock in order to 2818   // change p−>state and
2818   // change p−>state and then call sched.
2819   // Once we hold ptable.lock, we can be
2820   // guaranteed that we won’t miss any wakeup
2821   // (wakeup runs with ptable.lock locked),
2822   // so it’s okay to release lk.
2823   if(lk != &ptable.lock){
2824     acquire(&ptable.lock);
2825     release(lk);
2826   }
2827
2828   // Go to sleep.
2829   proc−>chan = chan;
2830   proc−>state = SLEEPING;
2831   sched();
2832
2833   // Tidy up.
2834   proc−>chan = 0;
2835
2836   // Reacquire original lock.
2837   if(lk != &ptable.lock){
2838     release(&ptable.lock);
2839     acquire(lk);
2840   }
2841 }
\end{verbatim}



\newpage

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\vfill

\part[10] Alyssa runs xv6 on a machine with 8 processors and 8 processes. Each
process calls uptime() (3738) system call continuously, reading the number of
ticks passed since boot. Alyssa measures the number of uptime() system calls
per second and notices that 8 processes achieve the same total throughput as 1
process, even though each process runs on a different processor. Why is the
throughput of 8 processes the same as that of 1 process?

\vfill

\end{parts}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Scheduling

\begin{parts}

\part[10] You would like to extend xv6 with priority based scheduler, i.e.,
each process has a priority, and processes with a higher priority are scheduled
first. Write the code for your implementation below (which xv6 functions need
to be changed?)

\newpage

\part[10] Now you would like to extend your priority scheduler with support for
interactive tasks, e.g., a task that spends a lot of time waiting, should run
first (i.e., receive priority boost). Provide code that handles waiting tasks
and implements priority boost (again, just change related xv6 functions). 

\end{parts} 


\newpage
\addpoints

\question Page tables. 


Xv6 uses 4MB page table during boot. It is defined as: 

\begin{verbatim} 
1406 // The boot page table used in entry.S and entryother.S.
1407 // Page directories (and page tables) must start on page boundaries,
1408 // hence the __aligned__ attribute.
1409 // PTE_PS in a page directory entry enables 4Mbyte pages.
1410
1411 __attribute__((__aligned__(PGSIZE)))
1412 pde_t entrypgdir[NPDENTRIES] = {
1413   // Map VA’s [0, 4MB) to PA’s [0, 4MB)
1414   [0] = (0) | PTE_P | PTE_W | PTE_PS,
1415   // Map VA’s [KERNBASE, KERNBASE+4MB) to PA’s [0, 4MB)
1416   [KERNBASE>>PDXSHIFT] = (0) | PTE_P | PTE_W | PTE_PS,
1417 };
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts}


\part[5] What virtual addresses (and to what physical addresses) does this page table map?

\vfill

\part[10] Imagine now that 4MB pages are not available, and you have to use
regular 4KB pages. How do you need to change the definition of entrypgdir for
xv6 to work correctly (provide code and short explanation).  

\vfill

\end{parts}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Process memory layout

Bob decides to mess up his friend Jack's xv6 environment by typing this in
hello.c
\begin{verbatim}
#define PGSIZE  4096
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char buf[PGSIZE] = {0};
  printf(1, "Hello World!, %p\n", buf);
  exit();
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts}
\part[10] Jack types hello and encounters a trap message such as this.
  \begin{verbatim}
  pid 3 hello: trap 14 err 7 on cpu 1 eip 0x22 addr 0x1fd0--kill proc
  \end{verbatim}
  Can you help Jack understand the problem? (To receive full points, you
  should explain why this error happened, what does the values signify and
  how to solve this)

  \vfill

\end{parts}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Virtual memory

Jimmy always had a desire to access physical memory directly from the user
space. He digs into the kernel sources and comes across this cool macro
V2P() all over the kernel.
\begin{verbatim}
#define KERNBASE  0xC0000000 // Kernel memory starts at 3GiB
#define V2P(a) (((uint) (a)) - KERNBASE)
\end{verbatim}

He decides to access the memory of his userspace buffer using this macro
and encounters a strange error.
\begin{verbatim}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a = 0xdeadbeef;
  *(uint*)V2P(&a) = 0xaddb;
  printf(1, "I changed physical memory %x\n", a);
  exit();
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts}
  \part[5] Can you enlighten Jimmy by drawing a page table layout and
  explain what's wrong with his code?
  \vfill
  \pagebreak
  \part[5] Can Jimmy's desire of accessing physical memory from userspace
  be fulfilled? Explain your answer
  \vfill
\end{parts}


\newpage
\addpoints
\question Process creation


While editing the xv6 code, Jimmy accidentally erases the below section of
code under fork() function on proc.c
\begin{verbatim}
2584 for(i = 0; i < NOFILE; i++)
2585    if(proc->ofile[i])
2586        np->ofile[i] = filedup(proc->ofile[i]);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts}
\part[5] Explain what the above section of code does?

  \vfill

\part[10] Explain where things can go wrong without this code. Quote a
  concrete example.

  \vfill

\end{parts}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question System call API

Alice was reading the fork.c on the IDE and her cat suddenly jumped on the keyboard
that changed the line 204 from 
\begin{verbatim}
203   // Clear %eax so that fork returns 0 in the child.
204   np->tf->eax = 0;
\end{verbatim}
to
\begin{verbatim}
203   // Clear %eax so that fork returns 0 in the child.
204   np->tf->eax = 1;
\end{verbatim}

Now she executes the following program
\begin{verbatim}
main() {
  char *msg = "foo\n";
  int pid = fork();
  if (pid){
    msg = "bar\n";
  } else {
    msg = "baz\n";
  }
  write(1, msg, 4);
  exit(0);
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{parts}
  \part[5] Assume that the system has booted properly and fork() succeeds.
  What would be the output of the above program? Explain your answer
  \vfill

\vfill

\part[2] Any suggestions for how to improve ics143A?

\question You are given a task of porting xv6 on the hardware that is identical 
to x86, but does not have a paging mechanism. 

\begin{parts}
\part[10] How will you implement address spaces? Remember that address spaces 
provide two key properties: illusion of a private memory, and isolation. Draw a 
figure of an address space layout for 2 processes and the kernel. Provide 
discussion of the mechanisms involved into your implementation.  

\vfill
\part[10] Remember that user processes on xv6 have only one interface to change 
their memory allocation---the \texttt{sbrk(n)} system call that allows the 
process to change its memory allocation growing it by n bytes (or shrinking it 
if a negative value is provided). How will you support \texttt{sbrk()} in your 
xv6 port? What are the data structures required? Provide a design discussion. 

\vfill
\newpage
\part[10] What if two processes want to share a region of memory? Can you 
suggest an interface and implementation for your port? What are the limitations 
of this mechanism, e.g. how many processes can share a region of memory 
simultaneously, how many sharing regions can be established? 

\vfill
\part[10] Discuss advantages and disadvantages of giving up the paging 
mechanism.
