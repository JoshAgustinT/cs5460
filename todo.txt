01 Introduction
  -- it took me two lectures to go through this (cut to fit in one)

02 - Calling conventions

  -- Maybe some examples from 03 - Linking and loading better fit in this
lecture. 

03 - Linking and Loading

  -- It gets repetitive and boring 
   
  -- Examples are not very clean and somewhat repetitive. Clean them up so I
can get to PIC even in the undergrad class.  

    -- Motivate the simple b = a example ... the next one seems similar. Maybe
